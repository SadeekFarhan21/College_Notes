\section{January 6, 2025}
We didn't have any, but Dr.\ Lipnowski did post a module on
\href{https://carmen.osu.edu}{{\texttt{carmen}}} about the syllabus and the
course. This semester we will be covering the first few chapters of the book
\textit{Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications} by Thomas Judson. \\

\section{January 8, 2025}
Professor Lipnowski discussed Sam Lloyd's 15 puzzle. Each lecture will include
a mystery digit, contributing up to 5\% bonus to the final grade based on
correct guesses.

Certain course expectations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All assignments (one every two weeks) and exams (one midterm and one final
          exam) will be take-home.
    \item All the problems from the course textbook.
    \item Collaboration is encouraged, but the work should be your own.
    \item For the exams, we are not supposed to talk to other friends.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functions}
\begin{definition}
    Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. A function $f: A \to B$ assigns exactly one output $f(a) \in B$ to every input $a \in A$.
\end{definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The set $A$ is called the \textbf{domain} of $f$.
    \item The set $B$ is called the \textbf{codomain} of $f$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{fact}The domain $A$, codomain $B$, and the assignment of outputs $f(a)$ to every input $a \in A$ are all part of the data defining a function. Just writing a formula like $f(x) = e^x$ does not determine a function, as the domain and codomain are not specified.
\end{fact}
For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, f(x) = e^x$.
    \item $f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}, f(x) = e^x$.
\end{itemize}
Although these functions use the same formula, their meanings are completely different because their domains and codomains differ.

\subsection{Graphs}
A function $f: A \to B$ is often identified with its \textbf{graph} in $A
    \times B$:
\[ \text{graph}(f) = \{(a, b) \in A \times B : b = f(a)\}. \]

\begin{lemma}
    Let $f: A \to B$ be a function. Its graph, $\text{graph}(f)$, passes the \textbf{vertical line test}: For every $a \in A$, $V_a := \{(a, b) \in A \times B : b \in B\}$ intersects $\text{graph}(f)$ in exactly one element.
\end{lemma}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[thick,->] (-2,0) -- (2,0) node[right] {$x$};
        \draw[thick,->] (0,-2) -- (0,2) node[above] {$y$};
        \draw[domain=-1.5:1.5,smooth,variable=\x,blue,thick] plot ({\x},{\x^2});
        \draw[dashed] (-1,0) -- (-1,1) node[midway,left] {Vertical line test};
        \draw[fill=red] (-1,1) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{proposition}
    Let $G \subseteq A \times B$ be any subset passing the vertical line test, i.e., for all $a \in A$, $V_a \cap G$ consists of exactly one element. Then $G = \text{graph}(f)$ for a unique function $f: A \to B$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    If $G = \{(a, b) \mid b \in B\}$ satisfies the vertical line test, define $f: A \to B$ by $f(a) = b$. Then $G = \text{graph}(f)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    A subset $R \subseteq A \times B$ is called a \textbf{relation}. The vertical line test distinguishes graphs of functions from more general relations.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $S = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 = 1\}$ (the unit circle). This
          is a relation but not the graph of a function because it fails the vertical
          line test: The vertical line $x = 0$ intersects the circle at two points.
    \item Visual depiction of a unit circle:
          \begin{center}
              \begin{tikzpicture}
                  \draw[thick,->] (-2,0) -- (2,0) node[right] {$x$};
                  \draw[thick,->] (0,-2) -- (0,2) node[above] {$y$};
                  \draw[thick] (0,0) circle (1.5);
                  \node[below right] at (2,2.5) {$x^2 + y^2 = 1$};
                  \draw[dashed] (0.5,-1.5) -- (0.5,1.5);
              \end{tikzpicture}
          \end{center}
    \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $B = \{4, 5\}$. The number of functions from $A$ to $B$
          is $2^3 = 8$, corresponding to the $8$ associated graphs in $A \times B$.
    \item The number of relations from $A$ to $B$ is $2^{ |a| \cdot |b|} = 2^{3 \cdot 2}
              = 64$, containing the $8$ graphs of functions from $A$ to $B$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{fact}
    The notion of relation is much more permissive than the notion of functions.
\end{fact}

\subsection{Visualizing Functions as Directed Edges}
A function $f: A \to B$ can be visualized as a collection of directed edges
$(a, f(a)) \in A \times B$. Each element of $A$ has exactly one outgoing edge
in the graph.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node[circle,draw] (A1) at (0,1) {$1$};
        \node[circle,draw] (A2) at (0,0) {$2$};
        \node[circle,draw] (A3) at (0,-1) {$3$};
        \node[circle,draw] (B1) at (2,0.5) {$4$};
        \node[circle,draw] (B2) at (2,-0.5) {$5$};
        \draw[->] (A1) -- (B1);
        \draw[->] (A2) -- (B2);
        \draw[->] (A3) -- (B1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection{Injection and Surjection}

Let $f : A \to B$ be a function.

\begin{definition}[Injectivity (One-to-One)]

    $f$ is injective (one-to-one) if:
    \[
        \forall x, y \in A, \, f(x) = f(y) \implies x = y
    \]
    Equivalently:
    \[
        x \neq y \implies f(x) \neq f(y)
    \]\end{definition}

\begin{fact} Distinct inputs have distinct outputs.
\end{fact}

\begin{definition}[Surjectivity (Onto)]

    $f$ is surjective (onto) if:
    \[
        \forall b \in B, \, \exists a \in A \text{ such that } f(a) = b.
    \]

\end{definition}

\begin{fact}
    Every $b \in B$ is an output of something through $f$.''

\end{fact}

\begin{example}
    Here are a few examples of injectivity and surjectivity:
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5\}$ and $f: A \to B$ with $f(1), f(2),
                  f(3)$ as elements of $B$. If $B$ has only two elements, at least two of $f(1),
                  f(2), f(3)$ must coincide (e.g., $f(1) = f(2)$). Thus, $f$ is not injective.
        \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $f : A \to B$ where:
              \[
                  f(1) = 4, \, f(2) = 7, \, f(3) = 5.
              \]
              Distinct inputs have distinct outputs, so $f$ is injective.
        \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $f : A \to B$ where:
              \[
                  f(1) = 4, \, f(2) = 4, \, f(3) = 6.
              \]
              Here, $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $f(1) = f(2)$ but $1 \neq
                  2$, so $f$ is not injective.
        \item Let $f : A \to B$ where $B$ has size 4 and $f(1), f(2), f(3)$ are distinct
              elements of $B$. If $B \setminus \{f(1), f(2), f(3)\}$ is non-empty, then $b
                  \neq f(a)$ for all \(a \in A\), implying \(f\) is non surjective.
        \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5\}$ and $f: A \to B$ with $f(1) = 4, f(2)
                  = 5, f(3) = 4$. $f$ is surjective.
        \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5\}$ and $f: A \to B$ with $f(1) = 4, f(2)
                  = 4, f(3) = 4$. $f$ is not surjective.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\subsection{Bijection and Range}
\begin{definition} [Bijectivity]

    $f$ is bijective if $f$ is both injective and surjective.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}

    Let $f : A \to B$ be a function. The \textit{range} of $f$ is the subset of $B$
    defined as:
    \[
        \text{range}(f) := \{ b \in B \mid b = f(a) \text{ for some } a \in A \}.
    \]
    Thus, $f : A \to B$ is surjective \(\Longleftrightarrow\) $\text{range}(f) =
        B$.
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$ and $f : A \to B$ where:
          \[
              f(1) = 6, \, f(2) = 5, \, f(3) = 4.
          \]
          $f$ is a bijection.
    \item Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$ and $f : A \to B$ where:
          \[
              f(1) = 4, \, f(2) = 4, \, f(3) = 56
          \]
          $f$ is neither injective nor surjective.

\end{itemize}
\begin{question*}
    Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets of the same size. Prove that the following are
    equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f : A \to B$ is injective.
        \item $f : A \to B$ is bijective.
        \item $f : A \to B$ is surjective.
    \end{enumerate}
    Demonstrate that (1), (2), and (3) are not necessarily equivalent if $A = B = \mathbb{N}$.
\end{question*}
\begin{example}
    Let $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ be defined as:
    \[
        f(n) =
        \begin{cases}
            n / 2              & \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\
            -\frac{(n + 1)}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
        \end{cases}
    \]
    is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
    \textbf{Injectivity:} Suppose $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$. Then:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $f(n_1) = f(n_2) > 0$, then $n_1, n_2$ must be even and
              \[
                  \frac{n_1}{2} = f(n_1) = f(n_2) = \frac{n_2}{2} \implies n_1 = n_2.
              \]

        \item If $f(n_1) = f(n_2) < 0$, then $n_1, n_2$ must both be odd and
              \[
                  -\frac{n_1 + 1}{2} = f(n_1) = f(n_2) = -\frac{n_2 + 1}{2} \implies n_1 = n_2.
              \]
    \end{itemize}

    In all cases, $n_1 = n_2$.

    It follows that $f$ is injective. \\ \textbf{Surjectivity:} Let $n \in
        \mathbb{Z}$.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $n > 0$, then
              \[
                  n = f(2n).
              \]
        \item If $n < 0$, then
              \[
                  n = f(-2n - 1).
              \]
    \end{itemize}

    \[
        \therefore \, f \text{ is surjective.}
    \]
\end{proof}
