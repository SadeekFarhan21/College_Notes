                    <p> Welcome to my website! I am a third-year mathematics PhD student at Stanford (supported by an
                        NSF Graduate Research Fellowship), advised by Persi Diaconis. I previously graduated from MIT
                        (class of 2022) with a double major in math and physics. I'm interested in studying probability,
                        combinatorics, and/or mathematical physics, but it might be a while longer before I have
                        anything interesting to say about them :) If you're here, you probably know that I take detailed
                        notes for a lot of my classes; click <a href="notes.html">here</a> to see them. </p>

                                    <h2> Non-academic things I did in undergrad </h2>
                                    <p> I was a codirector of the <a href="./html/vgo.mit.html">MIT Video Game
                                            Orchestra</a> in my senior year, and I sang with the MIT Asymptones and
                                        played in the MIT Symphony Orchestra during my first year at MIT. Music
                                        performance is important to me, but I am still thinking about how best to
                                        explore it going forward. <br><br> I was also an admin for the <a
                                            href="./html/esp.mit.edu.html">MIT Educational Studies Program</a>; in 2019,
                                        I codirected <a href="./html/Splash.html">MIT Splash</a>, a weekend-long
                                        educational program for thousands of high school students. Other than that, I
                                        also took on various officer positions in <a
                                            href="./html/hmmt.org.html">HMMT</a> and was a member of the <a
                                            href="./html/comm.mit.edu.html">Council for Math Majors</a>.<br><br> </p>

                                    <p> If you'd like your LaTeX document to look like the ones that I make, feel free
                                        to try using my <a href="./html/lindrew.sty.html" download="">style package</a>!
                                        Including this file in your project and starting a document with
                                        "\usepackage{lindrew}" will import all of the shortcuts / formatting that I use.
