                                        Winter 2024, and Autumn 2023. Before that, I was a Course Assistant for Math 20
                                        (Calculus) in Autumn 2022.</p>

                                    <p> At MIT, I was an Undergraduate Assistant for 18.100B (Real Analysis), as well as
                                        a Teaching Assistant for 18.600 (Probability and Random Variables) for two
                                        semesters. Those were some of my academic highlights during my time as an
                                        undergrad, and I'm happy to talk about my experiences TAing! I've also done some
